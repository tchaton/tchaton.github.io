Hey there,

I just started to build my blog using Jekyll and github pages. I’m new to this framework so the layout is currently only default but I’ll be working on it to make it a bit more personal.

Who am I?
---

My name is Cédric Ernewein and I’m an engineering student at the French engineering school Ecole Centrale de Lyon, I’ll be graduating (if everything works out well!) in 2019. The school is what is called in France a “generalistic school”, indeed my curriculum covered many different areas of engineering, ranging from fluid mechanics to computer science but also social sciences like economics or management. Before going to Ecole Centrale I took two years of a “prep class” from 2013 to 2015 at Lycée Kléber in Strasbourg, these are two intensive years in mathematics and physics, it’s also the place I discovered Python for scientific programming, preparing us for the entrance exams of French engineering schools, I integrated my school through the “Concours Centrale Supélec”, you can check out all of this online.

Although my school is multidisciplinary, I’ve always been the most interested in computer science, I’ve always been teaching myself stuff by going through online courses, building small apps and programs. Recently I discovered machine learning and deep learning, fields that I appreciate because they have a different approach from classic programming, and based on more mathematical concepts, another field I like. I also find machine learning interesting because of the many various applications it has, and the fact that it is still a field of research where new techniques are produced on a regular basis, which makes it a very fast moving field.

I’m currently doing an internship in data science at Amadeus IT Group, a big European IT company specialized in the travel industry (they process the ticketing for example). It’s been two month now at the time I’m writing this post and find it very fascinating, also I get hands on experience using python for data wrangling and machine learning. This internship is part of my curriculum, but after it I’m doing a gap year in which I want to move in some other countries than France, and I’d love to discover life in a startup, I’ll focus on Berlin and London for research on internship places.
Enough of discussing my personal life, let’s move on!

Why did I start a blog?
----

It’s been a certain time I wanted to share my experience on personal projects and the issues I faced. The purpose of this blog is to open my experience to the online community, I’ll add a comments section using disqus soon, so that my blog will become a bit more interactive. I’ll probably also be writing articles on medium once I gathered some experience writing stories.

I’ll start by explaining the projects I’ve already worked on, they include a 2048 game coded in C++ and QT, a mini battleships game playable in browser built with nodejs, and an app built using the ionic framework (awesome framework!).
I’ll also be covering the current projects I’m working on. I’ll start with a series on a self-driving car in GTA V using python and tensorflow, a project I’m working on with other interns at Amadeus.

See you soon for updates :)

Cédric
